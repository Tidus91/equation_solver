# equation_solver

this program will resolve any equation less than 3rd degree in R.
you can write your equation in normal form like you would do IRL : "3 + 2x - 3x^2 = 0 " -> valid.

it will print : 
- the normal form of the equation 
- the polynomial degree
- the number of solutions 
- the solutions

v2 : solve your equation in C
